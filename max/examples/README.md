# MAX examples

These examples demonstrate the power and flexibility of
[MAX](https://docs.modular.com/max/). They include:

## [MAX Pipelines](graph-api/pipelines/)

End-to-end demonstrations of common AI workloads and more, built using
[Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/) and the
[MAX Graph API](https://docs.modular.com/max/graph/).

## [PyTorch and ONNX inference on MAX](inference/)

MAX has the power to accelerate existing PyTorch and ONNX models directly, and
provides Python, Mojo, and C APIs for this. These examples showcase common
models from these frameworks and how to run them even faster via MAX.

## [MAX Engine extensibility](extensibility/)

MAX can be extended through the definition of custom operations, either
through [defining them for PyTorch and ONNX models](https://docs.modular.com/max/extensibility/custom-op)
or [introducing them into MAX Graphs](https://docs.modular.com/max/extensibility/graph-custom-op).
Several different examples demonstrate how to define custom ops in Mojo.

## [Jupyter notebooks](notebooks/)

Jupyter notebooks that showcase PyTorch and ONNX models being accelerated
through MAX.

## [Performance showcase](performance-showcase/)

A head-to-head benchmark of inference performance for common models that
demonstrates the advantages of running them with MAX.

## [Command-line tools](tools/)

MAX provides useful command-line tooling, and these examples demonstrate the
capabilities of these tools.

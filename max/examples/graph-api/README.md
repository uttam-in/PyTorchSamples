# MAX Graph API examples

These examples demonstrate the flexibility of the
[MAX Graph API](https://docs.modular.com/max/graph/), a
[Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/) interface to the advanced graph compiler
within MAX.

## [MAX Pipelines](pipelines/)

End-to-end pipelines that demonstrate the power of
[MAX](https://docs.modular.com/max/) for accelerating common AI workloads, and
more. A common Mojo driver file for executing these pipelines is found in this
directory and can be invoked in a manner similar to the following:

```shell
mojo run_pipeline.ðŸ”¥ [pipeline] [options]
```

Explore each specific pipeline and follow the detailed instructions provided
in their README files within the [pipelines](./pipelines/) sub-repository.

## [Graph API introduction](basics/)

A basic Mojo Graph API example that provides an introduction to how to
stage and run a computational graph on MAX, following the
[getting started guide](https://docs.modular.com/max/graph/get-started).

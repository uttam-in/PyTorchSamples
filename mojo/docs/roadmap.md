This document captures the broad plan about how we plan to implement things in
Mojo, and some early thoughts about key design decisions. This is not a full
design spec for any of these features, but it can provide a "big picture" view
of what to expect over time. It is also an acknowledgement of major missing
components that we plan to add.

## Overall priorities

Mojo is still in early development and many language features will arrive in
the coming months. We are highly focused on building Mojo the right way (for
the long-term), so we want to fully build-out the core Mojo language features
before we work on other dependent features and enhancements.

Currently, that means we are focused on the core system programming features
that are essential to [Mojo's mission](why-mojo.html), and as outlined in the
following sections of this roadmap.

In the near-term, we will **not** prioritize "general goodness" work such as:

- Adding syntactic sugar and short-hands for Python.
- Adding features from other languages that are missing from Python (such as
  public/private declarations).
- Tackling broad Python ecosystem challenges like packaging.

If you have encountered any bugs with current Mojo behavior, please
[submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues).

If you have ideas about how to improve the core Mojo features, we prefer that
you first look for similar topics or start a new conversation about it
in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/discussions).

We also consider Mojo to be a new member of the Python family, so if you
have suggestions to improve the experience with Python, we encourage
you to propose these "general goodness" enhancements through the formal [PEP
process](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/).

### Why not add syntactic sugar or other minor new features?

We are frequently asked whether Mojo will add minor features that people love
in other languages but that are missing in Python, such as "implicit
return" at the end of a function, public/private access control, fixing Python
packaging, and various syntactic shorthands.  As mentioned above, we are
intentionally *not* adding these kinds of features to Mojo right now.
There are three major reasons for this:

- First, Mojo is still young: we are still "building a house" by laying down
major bricks in the type system and adding system programming features that
Python lacks. We know we need to implement support for many existing Python
features (compatibility is a massive and important goal of Mojo) and this work
is not done yet. We have limited engineering bandwidth and want focus on
building essential functionality, and we will not debate whether certain
syntactic sugar is important or not.

- Second, syntactic sugar is like mortar in a buildingâ€”its best use is to hold
the building together by filling in usability gaps. Sugar (and mortar) is
problematic to add early into a system: you can run into problems with laying
the next bricks because the sugar gets in the way. We have experience building
other languages (such as Swift) that added sugar early, which could have been
subsumed by more general features if time and care were given to broader
evaluation.

- Third, the Python community should tackle some of these ideas first. It is
important to us that Mojo be a good member of the Python family (a "Python++"),
not just a language with Pythonic syntax. As such, we don't want to needlessly
diverge from Python evolution: adding a bunch of features could lead to
problems down the road if Python makes incompatible decisions. Such a future
would fracture the community which would cause massively more harm than any
minor language feature could offset.

For all these reasons, "nice to have" syntactic sugar is not a priority, and we
will quickly close such proposals to avoid cluttering the issue tracker. If
you'd like to propose a "general goodness" syntactic feature, please do so with
the existing [Python PEP process](https://peps.python.org/pep-0000/). If/when
Python adopts a feature, Mojo will also add it, because Mojo's goal is to be a
superset. We are happy with this approach because the Python community is
better equipped to evaluate these features, they have mature code bases to
evaluate them with, and they have processes and infrastructure for making
structured language evolution features.

## Mojo SDK known issues

The [Mojo SDK](/mojo/manual/get-started/) is still in early development
and currently only available for Ubuntu Linux and macOS (Apple silicon)
systems. Here are some of the notable issues that we plan to fix:

- Missing native support for Windows, Intel Macs, and Linux distributions
  other than Ubuntu. Currently, we support Ubuntu systems with x86-64
  processors and Apple Silicon macOS. Support for more Linux distributions
  (including Debian and RHEL) and Windows is in progress.

- Python interoperability might fail when running a compiled Mojo program, with
  the message
  `Unable to locate a suitable libpython, please set MOJO_PYTHON_LIBRARY`. This
  is because we currently do not embed the Python version into the Mojo binary.
  For details and the workaround, see [issue
  #551](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/551).

- Mojo programs that import NumPy might fail with the following error:

  ```plaintext
  Importing the numpy C-extensions failed. This error can happen for
  many reasons, often due to issues with your setup or how NumPy was
  installed.
  ```

  This may occur because the version of NumPy doesn't match the Python
  interpreter Mojo is using. As a workaround, follow the instructions in
  [issue #1085](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1085#issuecomment-1771403719)
  to install a Python virtual environment using Conda. This can solve many
  issues with Python interoperability.

- Modular CLI install might fail and require `modular clean` before you
  re-install.

  If it asks you to perform auth, run `modular auth <MODULAR_AUTH>` and use the
  `MODULAR_AUTH` value shown for the `curl` command on [the download
  page](https://developer.modular.com/download).

- If you attempt to uninstall Mojo with `modular uninstall`, your subsequent
  attempt to install Mojo might fail with an HTTP 500 error code. If so, run
  `modular clean` and try again.

- Mojo REPL might hang (become unresponsive for more than 10 seconds) when
  interpreting an expression if your system has 4 GiB or less RAM. If you
  encounter this issue, please report it with your system specs.

Additionally, we're aware of some issues that we might not be able to solve,
but we mention them here with some more information:

- When installing Mojo, if you receive the error,
  `failed to reach URL https://cas.modular.com`, it could be because your
  network connection is behind a firewall. Try updating your firewall settings
  to allow access to these end points: `https://packages.modular.com` and
  `https://cas.modular.com`. Then retry with `modular clean` and
  `modular install mojo`.

- When installing Mojo, if you receive the error,
  `gpg: no valid OpenGPG data found`, this is likely because you are located
  outside our supported geographies. Due to US export control restrictions, we
  are unable to provide access to Mojo to users situated in specific countries.

- If using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you might face issues with WSL 1.
  We recommend you upgrade to WSL 2. To check the version, run `wsl -l -v`. If
  you're running WSL 1, refer to the
  [WSL upgrade instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2).

- When installing on macOS (Apple silicon), the Modular CLI install might fail
  with the message:

  ```plaintext
  modular: The arm64 architecture is required for this software.
  ```

  This occurs because Apple's Rosetta x86 emulation is active. Check the
  following:

  - Right click on the terminal application you use (for example,
    `Terminal.app`), click **Get Info**, and make sure the **Open in Rosetta**
    checkbox is not selected.

  - Run the following command:

    ```bash
    brew config | grep Rosetta
    ```

    If the output shows `Rosetta 2: True`, the x86 version of Homebrew is
    installed.
    [Uninstall and reinstall Homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew/install#uninstall-homebrew)
    before retrying the Modular installation.

    **Note:** Before uninstalling Homebrew, verify that you don't have other
    projects specifically depending on the x86 version of Homebrew.

You can see other [reported issues on
GitHub](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues).

## Small independent features

There are a number of features that are missing that are important to round out
the language fully, but which don't depend strongly on other features.  These
include things like:

- Improved package management support.
- Many standard library features, including copy-on-write data structures.
- Support for "top level code" at file scope.
- Algebraic data types like `enum` in Swift/Rust, and pattern matching.
- Many standard library types need refinement, including `Optional[T]` and
  `Result[T, Error]`.

## Ownership and Lifetimes

The ownership system is partially implemented, and is expected to get built out
in the next couple of months.  The basic support for ownership includes features
like:

- Capture declarations in closures.
- Borrow checker: complain about invalid mutable references.

Mojo has support for a safe `Reference` type, and it is used in the standard
library, but it is still under active development and not very pretty or nice
to use right now.

## Traits support

As of v0.6.0 Mojo has basic support for
[traits](/mojo/manual/traits.html#built-in-traits). Traits allow you
to specify a set of requirements for types to implement. Types can implement
those requirements to *conform to* the trait. Traits allow you to write
generic functions and generic containers, which can work with any type that
conforms to a given trait, instead of being hard-coded to work with a specific
type.

Currently, the only kind of requirements supported by traits are required method
signatures. The trait can't provide a default implementation for its required
methods, so each conforming type must implement all of the required methods.

A number of [built-in traits](/mojo/manual/traits.html#built-in-traits) are
already implemented in the standard library.

We plan to expand traits support in future releases. Planned features include:

- Support for default implementations of required methods.

- Support for a feature like Swift's extensions, allowing you to add a trait to
  a preexisting type.

- Add support for conditional conformances.

## Classes

Mojo still doesn't support classes, the primary thing Python programmers use
pervasively!  This isn't because we hate dynamism - quite the opposite.  It is
because we need to get the core language semantics nailed down before adding
them.  We expect to provide full support for all the dynamic features in Python
classes, and want the right framework to hang that off of.

When we get here, we will discuss what the right default is: for example, is
full Python hash-table dynamism the default? Or do we use a more efficient
model by default (e.g. vtable-based dispatch and explicitly declared stored
properties) and allow opt'ing into dynamism with a `@dynamic` decorator on the
class. More discussion is [in this proposal](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/main/proposals/mojo-and-dynamism.md).

## C/C++ Interop

Integration to transparently import Clang C/C++ modules.  Mojo's type system
and C++'s are very compatible, so we should be able to have something pretty
nice here. Mojo can leverage Clang to transparently generate a foreign function
interface between C/C++ and Mojo, with the ability to directly import functions:

```mojo
from "math.h" import cos

print(cos(0))
```

## Calling Mojo from Python

Currently you can call Python code from Mojo, but not the reverse: you can't
pass a Mojo callback to a Python function, or build a Python extension in Mojo.
We want to support calling Mojo from Python, but we want to do it right and we
need the core language to be more mature first.

## Full MLIR decorator reflection

All decorators in Mojo have hard-coded behavior in the parser. In time, we will
move these decorators to being compile-time metaprograms that use MLIR
integration. This may depend on C++ interop for talking to MLIR. This completely
opens up the compiler to programmers. Static decorators are functions executed
at compile-time with the capability to inspect and modify the IR of functions
and types.

```mojo
fn value(t: TypeSpec):
    t.__copyinit__ = # synthesize dunder copyinit automatically

@value
struct TrivialType: pass

fn full_unroll(loop: mlir.Operation):
    # unrolling of structured loop

fn main():
    @full_unroll
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
```

## Sharp Edges

The entire Modular kernel library is written in Mojo, and its development has
been prioritized based on the internal needs of those users. Given that Mojo is
still a young language, there are a litany of missing small features that many
Python and systems programmers may expect from their language, as well as
features that don't quite work the way we want to yet, and in ways that can be
surprising or unexpected. This section of the document describes a variety of
"sharp edges" in Mojo, and potentially how to work around them if needed. We
expect all of these to be resolved in time, but in the meantime, they are
documented here.

### No list or dict comprehensions

Mojo does not yet support Python list or dictionary comprehension expressions,
like `[x for x in range(10)]`, because Mojo's standard library has not yet
grown a standard list or dictionary type.

### No `lambda` syntax

Mojo does not yet support defining anonymous functions with the `lambda`
keyword.

### Parametric aliases

Mojo aliases can refer to parametric values but cannot themselves have
parameter lists. As of v0.6.0, you can create a parametric alias by aliasing
an unbound or partially-bound type. For example, the new `Scalar` type is
defined as:

```mojo
alias Scalar = SIMD[size=1]
```

This creates a parametric alias that you can use like this:

```mojo
var i = Scalar[DType.int8]
```

Parametric aliases with an explicit parameter list aren't yet supported:

```mojo
alias mul2[x: Int] = x * 2
# Error!
```

### `Exception` is actually called `Error`

In Python, programmers expect that exceptions all subclass the `Exception`
builtin class. The only available type for Mojo "exceptions" is `Error`:

```mojo
fn raise_an_error() raises:
    raise Error("I'm an error!")
```

The reason we call this type `Error` instead of `Exception` is because it's not
really an exception. It's not an exception, because raising an error does not
cause stack unwinding, but most importantly it does not have a stack trace. And
without polymorphism, the `Error` type is the only kind of error that can be
raised in Mojo right now.

### No Python-style generator functions

Mojo does not yet support Python-style generator functions (`yield` syntax).
These are "synchronous co-routines" -- functions with multiple suspend points.

### No `async for` or `async with`

Although Mojo has support for async functions with `async fn` and `async def`,
Mojo does not yet support the `async for` and `async with` statements.

### The `rebind` builtin

One of the consequences of Mojo not performing function instantiation in the
parser like C++ is that Mojo cannot always figure out whether some parametric
types are equal and complain about an invalid conversion. This typically occurs
in static dispatch patterns, like:

```mojo
fn take_simd8(x: SIMD[DType.float32, 8]): pass

fn generic_simd[nelts: Int](x: SIMD[DType.float32, nelts]):
    @parameter
    if nelts == 8:
        take_simd8(x)
```

The parser will complain,

```log
error: invalid call to 'take_simd8': argument #0 cannot be converted from
'SIMD[f32, nelts]' to 'SIMD[f32, 8]'
        take_simd8(x)
        ~~~~~~~~~~^~~
```

This is because the parser fully type-checks the function without instantiation,
and the type of `x` is still `SIMD[f32, nelts]`, and not `SIMD[f32, 8]`, despite
the static conditional. The remedy is to manually "rebind" the type of `x`,
using the `rebind` builtin, which inserts a compile-time assert that the input
and result types resolve to the same type after function instantiation.

```mojo
fn generic_simd[nelts: Int](x: SIMD[DType.float32, nelts]):
    @parameter
    if nelts == 8:
        take_simd8(rebind[SIMD[DType.float32, 8]](x))
```

### Scoping and mutability of statement variables

Python programmers understand that local variables are implicitly declared and
scoped at the function level. As the programming manual explains, this feature
is supported in Mojo only inside `def` functions. However, there are some
nuances to Python's implicit declaration rules that Mojo does not match 1-to-1.

For example, the scope of `for` loop iteration variables and caught exceptions
in `except` statements is limited to the next indentation block, for both `def`
and `fn` functions. Python programmers will expect the following program to
print "2":

```python
for i in range(3): pass
print(i)
```

However, Mojo will complain that `print(i)` is a use of an unknown declaration.
This is because whether `i` is defined at this line is dynamic in Python. For
instance the following Python program will fail:

```python
for i range(0): pass
print(i)
```

With `NameError: name 'i' is not defined`, because the definition of `i` is a
dynamic characteristic of the function. Mojo's lifetime tracker is intentionally
simple (so lifetimes are easy to use!), and cannot reason that `i` would be
defined even when the loop bounds are constant.

Also stated in the programming manual: in `def` functions, the function
arguments are mutable and re-assignable, whereas in `fn`, function arguments are
rvalues and cannot be re-assigned. The same logic extends to statement
variables, like `for` loop iteration variables or caught exceptions:

```mojo
def foo():
    try:
        bad_function():
    except e:
        e = Error() # ok: we can overwrite 'e'

fn bar():
    try:
        bad_function():
    except e:
        e = Error() # error: 'e' is not mutable
```

### Name scoping of nested function declarations

In Python, nested function declarations produce dynamic values. They are
essentially syntax sugar for `bar = lambda ...`.

```python
def foo():
    def bar(): # creates a function bound to the dynamic value 'bar'
        pass
    bar() # indirect call
```

In Mojo, nested function declarations are static, so calls to them are direct
unless made otherwise.

```mojo
fn foo():
    fn bar(): # static function definition bound to 'bar'
        pass
    bar() # direct call
    var f = bar # materialize 'bar' as a dynamic value
    f() # indirect call
```

Currently, this means you cannot declare two nested functions with the same
name. For instance, the following example does not work in Mojo:

```mojo
def pick_func(cond) -> def() capturing:
    if cond:
        def bar(): return 42
    else:
        def bar(): return 3 # error: redeclaration of 'bar'
    return bar
```

The functions in each conditional must be explicitly materialized as dynamic
values.

```mojo
def pick_func(cond)  -> def() capturing:
    var result: def() capturing # Mojo function type
    if cond:
        def bar0(): return 42
        result = bar0
    else:
        def bar1(): return 3
        result = bar1
    return result
```

We hope to sort out these oddities with nested function naming as our model
of closures in Mojo develops further.

### Limited polymorphism

Mojo has implemented static polymorphism through traits, as noted above. We
plan to implement dynamic polymorphism through classes and MLIR reflection in
the future.

Python programmers are used to implementing special dunder methods on their
classes to interface with generic methods like `print()` and `len()`. For
instance, one expects that implementing `__repr__()` or `__str__()` on a class
will enable that class to be printed using `print()`.

```python
class One:
    def __init__(self): pass
    def __repr__(self): return '1'

print(One()) # prints '1'
```

Mojo currently supports this feature through the
[`Stringable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/str/Stringable) trait, so that
`print()` works on all `Stringable` types. Similar support exists for the
[`int()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int/int-function) and
[`len()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/len/len) functions. We'll continue to
add traits support to the standard library to enable common use cases like this.

### Parameter closure captures are unsafe references

You may have seen nested functions, or "closures", annotated with the
`@parameter` decorator. This creates a "parameter closure", which behaves
differently than a normal "stateful" closure. A parameter closure declares a
compile-time value, similar to an `alias` declaration. That means parameter
closures can be passed as parameters:

```mojo
fn take_func[f: fn() capturing -> Int]():
    pass

fn call_it(a: Int):
    @parameter
    fn inner() -> Int:
        return a # capture 'a'

    take_func[inner]() # pass 'inner' as a parameter
```

Parameter closures can even be parametric and capturing:

```mojo
fn take_func[f: fn[a: Int]() capturing -> Int]():
    pass

fn call_it(a: Int):
    @parameter
    fn inner[b: Int]() -> Int:
        return a + b # capture 'a'

    take_func[inner]() # pass 'inner' as a parameter
```

However, note that parameter closures are always capture by *unsafe* reference.
Mojo's lifetime tracking is not yet sophisticated enough to form safe references
to objects (see above section). This means that variable lifetimes need to be
manually extended according to the lifetime of the parametric closure:

```mojo
fn print_it[f: fn() capturing -> String]():
    print(f())

fn call_it():
    var s: String = "hello world"
    @parameter
    fn inner() -> String:
        return s # 's' captured by reference, so a copy is made here
    # lifetime tracker destroys 's' here

    print_it[inner]() # crash! 's' has been destroyed
```

The lifetime of the variable can be manually extended by discarding it
explicitly.

```mojo
fn call_it():
    var s: String = "hello world"
    @parameter
    fn inner() -> String:
        return s

    print_it[inner]()
    _ = s^ # discard 's' explicitly
```

### The standard library has limited exceptions use

For historic and performance reasons, core standard library types typically do
not use exceptions. For instance, `DynamicVector` will not raise an
out-of-bounds access (it will crash), and `Int` does not throw on divide by
zero. In other words, most standard library types are considered "unsafe".

```mojo
var v = DynamicVector[Int](capacity=0)
print(v[1]) # could crash or print garbage values (undefined behaviour)

print(1//0) # does not raise and could print anything (undefined behaviour)
```

This is clearly unacceptable given the strong memory safety goals of Mojo. We
will circle back to this when more language features and language-level
optimizations are available.

### Nested functions cannot be recursive

Nested functions (any function that is not a top-level function) cannot be
recursive in any way. Nested functions are considered "parameters", and although
parameter values do not have to obey lexical order, their uses and definitions
cannot form a cycle. Current limitations in Mojo mean that nested functions,
which are considered parameter values, cannot be cyclic.

```mojo
fn try_recursion():
    fn bar(x: Int): # error: circular reference :<
        if x < 10:
            bar(x + 1)
```

### Only certain loaded MLIR dialects can be accessed

Although Mojo provides features to access the full power of MLIR, in reality
only a certain number of loaded MLIR dialects can be accessed in the Playground
at the moment.

The upstream dialects available in the Playground are the
[`index`](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/IndexOps/) dialect and the
[`LLVM`](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/LLVM/) dialect.

### `@value` is limited with trait conformance check

Structs with `@value` decorator still need to explicitly provide dundner
methods such as `__init__`, `__copyinit__`, and `__moveinit__` when
both of the following are true:

- The struct has one or more fields that are self referencing
  (such as `Pointer[Self]`).
- The struct declares conformance to a trait that requires these dunder
  methods.

```mojo
# test.mojo
@value
struct A(CollectionElement):
    # error: 'DynamicVector' parameter #0 has 'CollectionElement' type, but value has type 'A'
    var a: DynamicVector[Self]
```

In the example above, adding the `__moveinit__()` and `__copyinit__()` methods
required by `CollectionElement` resolves this error.

### `or` expression is statically typed

Because Mojo has static typing, the `or` expression can't currently mimic the
behavior of Python. In Python, the result type of the `or` expression is
dynamic, based on the runtime values:

```python
i: int = 0
s: str = "hello"
print(type(i or s)) # prints <class 'str'>
i = 5
print(type(i or s)) # prints <class 'int'>
```

In Mojo, given the expression `(a or b)`, the compiler needs to statically
determine a result type that the types of `a` and `b` can both be converted to.

For example, currently an `Int` can be implicitly converted to a `String`, but a
`String` can't be implicitly converted to an `Int`. So given an integer value
`i` and a string value `s`, the value of `(i or s)` will *always* be a `String`.

### `StringLiteral` behaves differently than `String`

String literals behave differently than `String` values in Mojo code. For
example:

```mojo
fn main():
    var g: Int = 0
    var h: String = "hello"
    print(g or h)  # prints `hello`
    print(g or "hello")  # prints `True`
```

While the `IntLiteral` and `FloatLiteral` types convert or *materialize* at
runtime into `Int` and `Float64` values, respectively, string literals continue
to exist at runtime as `StringLiteral` values. This can result in surprising
behavior because `StringLiteral` has a more restricted API than `String`.

In the example above, because the `or` expression is statically typed,
and `Int` cannot be implicitly converted to a `StringLiteral`, the compiler
chooses a result type that both `Int` and `StringLiteral` can be converted toâ€”in
this case, `Bool`.

We plan to address this issue in the future, but in the near term, you can avoid
the inconsistency between `StringLiteral` and `String` problems by explicitly
converting string literals to `String` values. For example:

```mojo
var h: String = "hello"
# or
print(g or str("hello"))
```

# Mojo documentation

This directory includes most of the documentation at
[docs.modular.com/mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo).

The only things not here are the Jupyter notebooks, which are instead in the
[`examples/notebooks/`](../examples/notebooks/) directory, the `mojo` CLI pages,
and the Mojo Standard Library reference. The reference docs are generated from
source files, which are currently not open-sourced.

## Contributing

If you see something in the docs that is wrong or could be improved, we'd love
to accept your contributions.

Be aware that we don't provide tools to generate a preview of the website,
because the Mojo docs are built along with other content that's not included in
this repo. As such, we recommend you preview your edits in an IDE that can
render markdown and Jupyter notebook files, such as VS Code, including the [VS
Code environment in GitHub](https://github.dev/modularml/mojo/blob/main/).

For more information about how to contribute, see the [Contributor
Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

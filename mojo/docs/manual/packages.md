Mojo provides a packaging system that allows you to organize and compile code
libraries into importable files. This page introduces the necessary concepts
about how to organize your code into modules and packages (which is a lot
like Python), and shows you how to create a packaged binary with the [`mojo
package`](/mojo/cli/package.html) command.

## Mojo modules

To understand Mojo packages, you first need to understand Mojo modules. A
Mojo module is a single Mojo source file that includes code suitable for use
by other files that import it. For example, you can create a module
to define a struct such as this one:

```{.mojo filename="mymodule.mojo"}
struct MyPair:
    var first: Int
    var second: Int

    fn __init__(inout self, first: Int, second: Int):
        self.first = first
        self.second = second

    fn dump(self):
        print(self.first, self.second)
```

Notice that this code has no `main()` function, so you can't execute
`mymodule.mojo`. However, you can import this into another file with a
`main()` function and use it there.

For example, here's how you can import `MyPair` into a file named `main.mojo`
that's in the same directory as `mymodule.mojo`:

```{.mojo filename="main.mojo"}
from mymodule import MyPair

fn main():
    var mine = MyPair(2, 4)
    mine.dump()
```

Alternatively, you can import the whole module and then access its members
through the module name. For example:

```{.mojo filename="main.mojo"}
import mymodule

fn main():
    var mine = mymodule.MyPair(2, 4)
    mine.dump()
```

You can also create an alias for an imported member with `as`, like this:

```{.mojo filename="main.mojo"}
import mymodule as my

fn main():
    var mine = my.MyPair(2, 4)
    mine.dump()
```

In this example, it only works when `mymodule.mojo` is in the same directory as
`main.mojo`. Currently, you can't import `.mojo` files as modules if they
reside in other directories. That is, unless you treat the directory as a Mojo
package, as described in the next section.

:::note

Mojo module may include a `main()` function and may also be
executable, but that's generally not the practice and modules typically include
APIs to be imported and used in other Mojo programs.

:::

## Mojo packages

A Mojo package is just a collection of Mojo modules in a directory that
includes an `__init__.mojo` file. By organizing modules together in a
directory, you can then import all the modules together or individually.
Optionally, you can also compile the package into a `.mojopkg` or `.ðŸ“¦` file
that's easier to share and still compatible with other system architectures.

You can import a package and its modules either directly from source files or
from a compiled `.mojopkg`/`.ðŸ“¦` file. It makes no real difference to Mojo
which way you import a package. When importing from source files, the directory
name works as the package name, whereas when importing from a compiled package,
the filename is the package name (which you specify with the [`mojo
package`](/mojo/cli/package.html) commandâ€”it can differ from the directory
name).

For example, consider a project with these files:

```ini
main.mojo
mypackage/
    __init__.mojo
    mymodule.mojo
```

`mymodule.mojo` is the same code from examples above (with the `MyPair`
struct) and `__init__.mojo` is empty.

In this case, the `main.mojo` file can now import `MyPair` through the package
name like this:

```{.mojo filename="main.mojo"}
from mypackage.mymodule import MyPair

fn main():
    var mine = MyPair(2, 4)
    mine.dump()
```

Notice that the `__init__.mojo` is crucial here. If you delete it, then Mojo
doesn't recognize the directory as a package and it cannot import `mymodule`.

Then, let's say you don't want the `mypackage` source code in the same location
as `main.mojo`. So, you can compile it into a package file like this:

```sh
mojo package mypackage -o mypack.mojopkg
```

:::note

A `.mojopkg` file contains non-elaborated code, so you can share it across
systems. The code becomes an architecture-specific executable only after it's
imported into a Mojo program that's then compiled with `mojo build`.

:::

Now, you can move the `mypackage` source somewhere else, and the project files
now look like this:

```ini
main.mojo
mypack.mojopkg
```

Because we named the package file different from the directory, we need to fix
the import statement and it all works the same:

```{.mojo filename="main.mojo"}
from mypack.mymodule import MyPair
```

:::note

If you want to rename your package, you cannot simply edit the
`.mojopkg` or `.ðŸ“¦` filename, because the package name is encoded in the file.
You must instead run `mojo package` again to specify a new name.

:::

### The `__init__` file

As mentioned above, the `__init__.mojo` file is required to indicate that a
directory should be treated as a Mojo package, and it can be empty.

Currently, top-level code is not supported in `.mojo` files, so unlike Python,
you can't write code in `__init__.mojo` that executes upon import. You can,
however, add structs and functions, which you can then import from the package
name.

However, instead of adding APIs in the `__init__.mojo` file, you can import
module members, which has the same effect by making your APIs accessible from
the package name, instead of requiring the `<package_name>.<module_name>`
notation.

For example, again let's say you have these files:

```ini
main.mojo
mypackage/
    __init__.mojo
    mymodule.mojo
```

Let's now add the following line in `__init__.mojo`:

```{.mojo filename="__init__.mojo"}
from .mymodule import MyPair
```

That's all that's in there. Now, we can simplify the import statement in
`main.mojo` like this:

```{.mojo filename="main.mojo"}
from mypackage import MyPair
```

This feature explains why some members in the Mojo standard library can be
imported from their package name, while others required the
`<package_name>.<module_name>` notation. For example, the
[`functional`](/mojo/stdlib/algorithm/functional.html) module resides in the
`algorithm` package, so you can import members of that module (such as the
`map()` function) like this:

```mojo
from algorithm.functional import map
```

However, the `algorithm/__init__.mojo` file also includes these lines:

```{.mojo filename="algorithm/__init__.mojo"}
from .functional import *
from .reduction import *
```

So you can actually import anything from `functional` or `reduction` simply by
naming the package. That is, you can drop the `functional` name from the import
statement, and it also works:

```mojo
from algorithm import map
```

:::note

Which modules in the standard library are imported to the package
scope varies, and is subject to change. Refer to the [documentation for each
module](/mojo/lib.html) to see how you can import its members.

We tried to anticipate your questions about Mojo on this page. If this page
doesn't answer all your questions, also check out our [Mojo community
channels](/mojo/community.html).

## Motivation

### Why did you build Mojo?

We built Mojo to solve an internal challenge at Modular, and we are using it
extensively in our systems such as our [AI
Engine](/engine). As a result, we are extremely committed to
its long term success and are investing heavily in it. Our overall mission is
to unify AI software and we can‚Äôt do that without a unified language that can
scale across the AI infrastructure stack. That said, we don‚Äôt plan to stop at
AI‚Äîthe north star is for Mojo to support the whole gamut of general-purpose
programming over time. For a longer answer, read [Why
Mojo](/mojo/why-mojo.html).

### Why is it called Mojo?

Mojo means ‚Äúa magical charm‚Äù or ‚Äúmagical powers.‚Äù We thought this was a fitting
name for a language that brings magical powers to Python, including unlocking
an innovative programming model for accelerators and other heterogeneous
systems pervasive in AI today.

### Why does mojo have the üî• file extension?

We paired Mojo with fire emoji üî• as a fun visual way to impart onto users that
Mojo empowers them to get their Mojo on‚Äîto develop faster and more efficiently
than ever before. We also believe that the world can handle a unicode extension
at this point, but you can also just use the `.mojo` extension. :)

### What problems does Mojo solve that no other language can?

Mojo combines the usability of Python with the systems programming features
it‚Äôs missing. We are guided more by pragmatism than novelty, but Mojo‚Äôs use of
[MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) allows it to scale to new exotic hardware types
and domains in a way that other languages haven‚Äôt demonstrated (for an example
of Mojo talking directly to MLIR, see our [low-level IR in Mojo
notebook](/mojo/notebooks/BoolMLIR.html)). It also
includes autotuning, and has caching and distributed compilation built into its
core. We also believe Mojo has a good chance of unifying hybrid packages in the
broader Python community.

### What kind of developers will benefit the most from Mojo?

Mojo‚Äôs initial focus is to bring programmability back to AI, enabling AI
developers to customize and get the most out of their hardware. As such, Mojo
will primarily benefit researchers and other engineers looking to write
high-performance AI operations. Over time, Mojo will become much more
interesting to the general Python community as it grows to be a superset of
Python. We hope this will help lift the vast Python library ecosystem and
empower more traditional systems developers that use C, C++, Rust, etc.

### Why build upon Python?

Effectively, all AI research and model development happens in Python today, and
there‚Äôs a good reason for this! Python is a powerful high-level language with
clean, simple syntax and a massive ecosystem of libraries. It‚Äôs also one of the
world's [most popular programming
languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), and we want to help it become
even better. At Modular, one of our core principles is meeting customers where
they are‚Äîour goal is not to further fragment the AI landscape but to unify and
simplify AI development workflows.

### Why not enhance CPython (the major Python implementation) instead?

We‚Äôre thrilled to see a big push to improve
[CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython) by the existing community, but
our goals for Mojo (such as to deploy onto GPUs and other accelerators) need a
fundamentally different architecture and compiler approach underlying it.
CPython is a significant part of our compatibility approach and powers our
Python interoperability.

### Why not enhance another Python implementation (like Codon, PyPy, etc)?

Codon and PyPy aim to improve performance compared to CPython, but Mojo‚Äôs goals
are much deeper than this. Our objective isn‚Äôt just to create ‚Äúa faster
Python,‚Äù but to enable a whole new layer of systems programming that includes
direct access to accelerated hardware, as outlined in [Why
Mojo](/mojo/why-mojo.html). Our technical implementation
approach is also very different, for example, we are not relying on heroic
compiler and JIT technologies to ‚Äúdevirtualize‚Äù Python.

Furthermore, solving big challenges for the computing industry is hard and
requires a fundamental rethinking of the compiler and runtime infrastructure.
This drove us to build an entirely new approach and we‚Äôre willing to put in the
time required to do it properly (see our blog post about [building a
next-generation AI
platform](https://www.modular.com/blog/the-case-for-a-next-generation-ai-developer-platform)),
rather than tweaking an existing system that would only solve a small part of
the problem.

### Why not make Julia better?

We think [Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a great language and it has a
wonderful community, but Mojo is completely different. While Julia and Mojo
might share some goals and look similar as an easy-to-use and high-performance
alternative to Python, we‚Äôre taking a completely different approach to building
Mojo. Notably, Mojo is Python-first and doesn't require existing Python
developers to learn a new syntax.

Mojo also has a bunch of technical advancements compared to Julia, simply
because Mojo is newer and we‚Äôve been able to learn from Julia (and from Swift,
Rust, C++ and many others that came before us). For example, Mojo takes a
different approach to memory ownership and memory management, it scales down to
smaller envelopes, and is designed with AI and MLIR-first principles (though
Mojo is not only for AI).

That said, we also believe there‚Äôs plenty of room for many languages and this
isn‚Äôt an OR proposition. If you use and love Julia, that's great! We‚Äôd love for
you to try Mojo and if you find it useful, then that's great too.

## Functionality

### Where can I learn more about Mojo‚Äôs features?

The best place to start is the [Mojo Manual](/mojo/manual). And if you want to
see what features are coming in the future, take a look at [the
roadmap](/mojo/roadmap.html).

### What does it mean that Mojo is designed for MLIR?

[MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) provides a flexible infrastructure for building
compilers. It‚Äôs based upon layers of intermediate representations (IRs) that
allow for progressive lowering of any code for any hardware, and it has been
widely adopted by the hardware accelerator industry since [its first
release](https://blog.google/technology/ai/mlir-accelerating-ai-open-source-infrastructure/).
Although you can use MLIR to create a flexible and powerful compiler for any
programming language, Mojo is the world‚Äôs first language to be built from the
ground up with MLIR design principles. This means that Mojo not only offers
high-performance compilation for heterogeneous hardware, but it also provides
direct programming support for the MLIR intermediate representations. For a
simple example of Mojo talking directly to MLIR, see our [low-level IR in Mojo
notebook](/mojo/notebooks/BoolMLIR.html).

### Is Mojo only for AI or can it be used for other stuff?

Mojo is a general purpose programming language. We use Mojo at Modular to
develop AI algorithms, but as we grow Mojo into a superset of Python, you can
use it for other things like HPC, data transformations, writing pre/post
processing operations, and much more. For examples of how Mojo can be used for
other general programming tasks, see our [Mojo
examples](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/main/examples).

### Is Mojo interpreted or compiled?

Mojo supports both just-in-time (JIT) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. In
either a REPL environment or Jupyter notebook, Mojo is JIT‚Äôd. However, for AI
deployment, it‚Äôs important that Mojo also supports AOT compilation instead of
having to JIT compile everything. You can compile your Mojo programs using the
[`mojo` CLI](/mojo/cli/).

### How does Mojo compare to Triton Lang?

[Triton Lang](https://triton-lang.org/main/index.html) is a specialized
programming model for one type of accelerator, whereas Mojo is a more general
language that will support more architectures over time and includes a
debugger, a full tool suite, etc. For more about embedded domain-specific
languages (EDSLs) like Triton, read the ‚ÄúEmbedded DSLs in Python‚Äù section of
[Why
Mojo](/mojo/why-mojo.html#embedded-dsls-in-python).

### How does Mojo help with PyTorch and TensorFlow acceleration?

Mojo is a general purpose programming language, so it has no specific
implementations for ML training or serving, although we use Mojo as part of the
overall Modular AI stack. The [Modular AI
Engine](/engine), for example, supports deployment of PyTorch
and TensorFlow models, while Mojo is the language we use to write the engine‚Äôs
in-house kernels.

### Does Mojo support distributed execution?

Not alone. You will need to leverage the [Modular AI
Engine](/engine) for that. Mojo is one component of the
Modular stack that makes it easier for you to author highly performant,
portable kernels, but you‚Äôll also need a runtime (or ‚ÄúOS‚Äù) that supports graph
level transformations and heterogeneous compute.

### Will Mojo support web deployment (such as Wasm or WebGPU)?

We haven‚Äôt prioritized this functionality yet, but there‚Äôs no reason Mojo can‚Äôt
support it.

### How do I convert Python programs or libraries to Mojo?

Mojo is still early and not yet a Python superset, so only simple programs can
be brought over as-is with no code changes. We will continue investing in this
and build migration tools as the language matures.

### What about interoperability with other languages like C/C++?

Yes, we want to enable developers to port code from languages other than Python
to Mojo as well. We expect that due to Mojo‚Äôs similarity to the C/C++ type
systems, migrating code from C/C++ should work well and it‚Äôs in [our
roadmap](/mojo/roadmap.html#cc-interop).

### How does Mojo support hardware lowering?

Mojo leverages LLVM-level dialects for the hardware targets it supports, and it
uses other MLIR-based code-generation backends where applicable. This also
means that Mojo is easily extensible to any hardware backend. For more
information, read about our vision for [pluggable
hardware](https://www.modular.com/hardware).

### How does Mojo autotuning work?

For details about what autotuning capabilities we support so far, check out
the Mojo Manual section on [metaprogramming](/mojo/manual/parameters/).
But stay tuned for more details!

### Who writes the software to add more hardware support for Mojo?

Mojo provides all the language functionality necessary for anyone to extend
hardware support. As such, we expect hardware vendors and community members
will contribute additional hardware support in the future. We‚Äôll share more
details about opening access to Mojo in the future, but in the meantime, you
can read more about our [hardware extensibility
vision](https://www.modular.com/hardware).

### How does Mojo provide a 35,000x speed-up over Python?

Modern CPUs are surprisingly complex and diverse, but Mojo enables
systems-level optimizations and flexibility that unlock the features of any
device in a way that Python cannot. So the hardware matters for this sort of
benchmark, and for the Mandelbrot benchmarks we show in our [launch
keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Kf2ZZU-dg&t=1543s), we ran them on
an [AWS r7iz.metal-16xl](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/r7iz/)
machine.

For lots more information, check out our 3-part blog post series about
[how Mojo gets a 35,000x speedup over
Python](https://www.modular.com/blog/how-mojo-gets-a-35-000x-speedup-over-python-part-1).

By the way, all the kernels that power the [Modular AI
Engine](/engine) are written in Mojo. We also compared our
matrix multiplication implementation to other state-of-the-art implementations
that are usually written in assembly. To see the results, see [our blog post
about unified matrix
multiplication](https://www.modular.com/blog/the-worlds-fastest-unified-matrix-multiplication).

## Performance

### Mojo‚Äôs matmul performance in the notebook doesn‚Äôt seem that great. What‚Äôs going on?

The [Mojo Matmul
notebook](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/main/examples/notebooks/Matmul.ipynb)
uses matrix multiplication to show off some Mojo features in a scenario that
you would never attempt in pure Python. So that implementation is like a ‚Äútoy‚Äù
matmul implementation and it doesn‚Äôt measure up to the state of the art.

Modular has a separate matmul implementation written in Mojo and used by
[MAX Engine](/engine), which you can read about it in [this blog
post](https://www.modular.com/blog/the-worlds-fastest-unified-matrix-multiplication).

### Are there any AI related performance benchmarks for Mojo?

It‚Äôs important to remember that Mojo is a general-purpose programming language,
and any AI-related benchmarks will rely heavily upon other framework
components. For example, our in-house kernels for the [Modular AI
Engine](/engine) are all written in Mojo and you can learn more
about our kernel performance in our [matrix multiplication blog
post](https://www.modular.com/blog/the-worlds-fastest-unified-matrix-multiplication).
For details about our end-to-end model performance relative to the latest
releases of TensorFlow and PyTorch, check out our [performance
dashboard](https://www.modular.com/max/performance).

## Mojo SDK

### How can I get access to the SDK?

You can [get the Mojo SDK here](https://developer.modular.com/download)!

### Is the Mojo Playground still available?

Yes, but it's different. When we first announced Mojo, it was available
only through login, in a JupyterLab environment. Now that Mojo is available
for local development, we've shut down that service (you can instead [run
Mojo notebooks
locally](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/main/examples/notebooks#readme)).

The new [Mojo Playground](/mojo/playground) is built into the docs website
and does not require login.

- It provides access to Mojo and the Mojo standard library. It does not have
  network access, so you can't install additional Mojo or Python packages.

- It doesn't include any Python packages by default. In the future,
  we intend to make some common Python packages available to import in the
  Playground.

- You can download your code or share it as a gist, but there's no mechanism
  for saving code in the Playground itself. Any changes will be lost when you
  switch code examples (as well as in the event of a server refresh or update).
  If you come up with something you want to save, download it or share it
  using buttons in the Playground toolbar.

- There might be some bugs. Please [report issues and feedback on
  GitHub](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/new/choose).

### What are the license terms for the SDK?

Please read the [Mojo SDK License Terms](https://www.modular.com/legal/mojo).

### What does the Mojo SDK ship with?

The Mojo SDK includes the Mojo standard library and `mojo` command-line tool,
which provides a REPL similar to the `python` command, along with `build`,
`run`, `package`, `doc` and `format` commands. We've also published a [Mojo
language extension for VS
Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo).

### What operating systems are supported?

Currently, we support Ubuntu Linux 20.04/22.04 (64-bit x86) and macOS (Apple
silicon). Support for Windows will follow. Until then, you have several options:

- Windows users can use
  [Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2 (WSL 2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
  running a supported Linux distribution.
- Intel Mac users can use a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container running
  a supported Linux distribution.
- Users on any system can install the SDK on a remote machine running a
  supported Linux distribution.

### Is there IDE Integration?

Yes, we've published an official [Mojo language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo)
for VS Code.

The extension supports various features including syntax highlighting, code
completion, formatting, hover, etc. It works seamlessly with remote-ssh and dev
containers to enable remote development in Mojo.

### Does the Mojo SDK collect telemetry?

Yes, the Mojo SDK collects some basic system information, basic
compiler/runtime events, and crash reports that enable us to identify, analyze,
and prioritize Mojo issues.

This telemetry is crucial to help us quickly identify problems and improve our
products. Without this telemetry, we would have to rely on user-submitted bug
reports, and in our decades of experience building developer products, we know
that most people don‚Äôt do that. The telemetry provides us the insights we need
to build better products for you.

You can opt-out of the crash report and compiler/runtime telemetry, but
package install/update/uninstall events cannot be
disabled (see the [MAX SDK terms](https://www.modular.com/legal/max)).

To disable crash reports, use this command:

```sh
modular config-set crash_reporting.enabled=false
```

To reduce other telemetry to only the required telemetry events, use this
command:

```sh
modular config-set telemetry.level=0
```

There are 3 telemetry levels: `0` currently records nothing (unless you're also
using MAX, which records hardware information and session durations); `1`
records high-level events such as when the compiler is invoked; and `2` records
more detail such as the time spend compiling.

## Versioning & compatibility

### What‚Äôs the Mojo versioning strategy?

Mojo is still in early development and not at a 1.0 version yet. It‚Äôs
still missing many foundational features, but please take a look at our
[roadmap](/mojo/roadmap.html) to understand where things are headed. As such,
the language is evolving rapidly and source stability is not guaranteed.

### How often will you be releasing new versions of Mojo?

Mojo development is moving fast and we are regularly releasing updates.
Please join the [Mojo Discord channel](http://discord.gg/modular) for
notifications and [sign up for our newsletter](https://www.modular.com/newsletter)
for more coarse-grain updates.

## Mojo Playground {#mojo-playground}

### What sort of computer is backing each instance in the Mojo Playground?

The Mojo Playground runs on a fleet of [AWS EC2
C6i](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c6i/) (c6i.8xlarge) instances
that is divided among active users. Due to the shared nature of the system, the
number of vCPU cores provided to your session may vary. We guarantee 1 vCPU
core per session, but that may increase when the total number of active users is
low.

Each user also has a dedicated volume in which you can save your own files that
persist across sessions.

## Open Source

### Will Mojo be open-sourced?

We expect to open-source Mojo progressively over time as it continues to mature.
Mojo is still young, so we will continue to incubate it within Modular until
more of its internal architecture is fleshed out.

### Why not develop Mojo in the open from the beginning?

Mojo is a big project and has several architectural differences from previous
languages. We believe a tight-knit group of engineers with a common vision can
move faster than a community effort. This development approach is also
well-established from other projects that are now open source (such as LLVM,
Clang, Swift, MLIR, etc.).

## Community

### Where can I ask more questions or share feedback?

If you have questions about upcoming features or have suggestions
for the language, be sure you first read the [Mojo roadmap](roadmap.html), which
provides important information about our current priorities and links to
our GitHub channels where you can report issues and discuss new features.

To get in touch with the Mojo team and developer community, use the resources
on our [Mojo community page](/mojo/community.html).

### Can I share Mojo code from the Mojo Playground?

Yes! You‚Äôre welcome and encouraged to share your Mojo code any way you like.
We've added a feature in the Mojo Playground to make this easier, and you can
learn more in the Mojo Playground by opening the `help` directory in the file
browser.

However, the [Mojo SDK is also now available](/mojo/manual/get-started/), so
you can also share `.mojo` source files and `.ipynb` notebooks to run locally!

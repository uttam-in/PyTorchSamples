Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research and
production by combining the best of Python syntax with systems programming and
metaprogramming. With Mojo, you can write portable code that's faster than C
and seamlessly inter-op with the Python ecosystem.

The Mojo SDK is available for Linux and macOS! ðŸ”¥
